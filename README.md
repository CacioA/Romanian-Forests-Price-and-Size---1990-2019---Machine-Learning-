# Machine Learning Coursework

## Romanian forests surface and cost history - 1990 to 2019. 


### Created using:
> - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/nandinibagga/forest-surface-evolution-in-romania
> - Python, SciKit learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.
> - Algorithms: 
    1.Random Forest Regressor
    2. Linear Regression
    3. Decision Tree Regressor.
  
### Purpose of the project:

> - Starting project for ML to gain an insight on how to use Python and its libraries. 
> - Understanding historical data.
> - Predict future prices.
